# ðŸ“Š Comparative Analysis

## 1. Dataset Versions
- **100-entry dataset** â†’ Initial testing phase
- **200-entry dataset** â†’ Extended testing for scalability

## 2. Classification Performance
- Both datasets produced consistent accuracy
- IBM Granite handled Applications, Risks, Ethics, and Future Trends without bias

## 3. Summarization Results
- Short, coherent summaries for both dataset sizes
- Maintained focus on Applications, Risks, Ethics, and Future Trends

## 4. Observations
- Text length did not affect classification accuracy
- Balanced dataset improved model reliability
- More diverse data (200 entries) confirmed model scalability

## 5. Conclusion
- IBM Granite is reliable for small and medium datasets
- Increasing dataset size improves insight depth without reducing accuracy
- Future work: multilingual datasets, sentiment analysis, real-time API
